====================

Global linear model for named-entity recognition using the perceptron algorithm.

The training task consists of identifying gene names within a biological text.

The dataset is adapted from the BioCreAtIvE II project and contains one type
of named entity (GENE): http://biocreative.sourceforge.net/biocreative_2.html

Based on material from the excellent Coursera MOOC
"Natural Language Processing" taught by Michael Collins.
